## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap Framework
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge helped me to refresh my HTML, CSS & Bootstrap skills. I've learned using variable in CSS.

To see how i learned variable in css, see below:

```css
/* used root selector to store color codes in variables */
:root{
    --primary-text-color:#ffffff;
    --secondary-text-color:#f7f7f7;
}

/* used color codes stored in variable to apply on h1 & p tag, 
rather than applying direct color codes to h1 & p tag css */
.wrapper-content h1 {
    font-size: 20px;
    font-weight: 600;
    color: var(--primary-text-color); 
} 

.wrapper-content p {
    font-size: 12px;
    font-weight: lighter;
    color: var(--secondary-text-color);
}
```
### Continued development

I've completed this challenge using HTML, CSS & Bootstrap which is basic, but in future my target is to learn JS, ReactJS and other technologies required to become a good frontend developer.  

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand frontend concepts. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
